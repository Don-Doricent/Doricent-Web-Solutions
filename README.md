## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript (vanilla); lightweight tooling per project.

I keep client sites simple, fast, and maintainable. For each build I start with semantic HTML, accessible components, and mobile-first layout. CSS (or SCSS) handles design tokens and utilities; JavaScript adds just-enough interactivity (forms, nav, light dynamic content). Each project folder includes its own README with setup notes and a plan for future improvements.

## Optimizations

- Performance first: image compression, lazy loading, and minimal JS where possible.
- Accessibility passes: color contrast, focus states, keyboard nav, and ARIA where needed.
- Reusable bits: headers/footers, hero sections, and CTA blocks standardized across projects.
- Deployment-ready: clean file structure for quick pushes to Netlify/Vercel or simple static hosting.

---

## Lessons Learned

- Keep scope tight and ship: small iterations beat big redesigns.
- Accessibility isn’t an afterthought—bake it in from the first component.
- Content structure matters more than animations.
- Clients love clear READMEs and “what’s next” checklists.

## Running Locally

Most folders are static sites. Clone and open the `index.html` in your browser.  
If a project uses a dev server/bundler, see that folder’s README for commands.
